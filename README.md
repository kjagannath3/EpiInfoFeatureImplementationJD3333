# EpiInfoFeatureImplementation
Initial feature implementation; to be integrated with the rest of the Epi Info app later

For our feature implementation we decided to implement the view form MMF. We decided to choose this feature after 
discussing with our client what was the most integral feature for our preliminary implementation of our tech stack. 

They encouraged us to choose a feature that was basic but still an integral function of the app.
In this case, viewing the form is important for epidemiologists. They can access forms completed by 
their target audience (members of a community experiencing an epidemic) in an efficient and effective way.
