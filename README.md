# EpiInfoFeatureImplementation
This is the initial feature implementation repo for the Android version of Epi Info for team JIE-3333. 
This will eventually be integrated with the rest of the Epi Info application for global users.

For our feature implementation we decided to implement the view form MMF. We decided to choose this feature after 
discussing with our client what was the most integral feature for our preliminary implementation of our tech stack. 

They encouraged us to choose a feature that was basic but still an integral function of the app.
In this case, viewing the form is important for epidemiologists. They can access forms completed by 
their target audience (members of a community experiencing an epidemic) in an efficient and effective way.

For this feature that was implemented, we used Android Studio as our development IDE.
Our code was written in Kotlin and contains primarily .xml and .kt files.
We plan to implement our database aspect (which will be tied into Box) in the later sprints of the project.
We have three primary files for this feature: a home screen, a collect data screen and a view records screen.
We utilized the existing code base for EpiInfo from the CDC to get branded images/logos. 
The plan is to use more of the existing code as we implement more features and get a better understanding of the existing code.
